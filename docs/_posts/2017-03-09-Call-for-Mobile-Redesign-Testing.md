**Hello Everyone!**


On March 9, a new [look](https://mozilla.invisionapp.com/share/GY8O3Z4ZE#/screens) will be coming to addons.mozilla.org (AMO) for Android. This redesign will feature a cleaner, more user-friendly add-ons store on Android devices and tablets. We would love your help to track down any remaining bugs.

If you have access to an Android phone and a passion for bug-hunting, we encourage you to look at the instructions on this [etherpad](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/MozillaIN_QA_MobileRedesign-contributors-testing) and the Contributors Guide and start testing. No prior testing experience is required to contribute. Please be sure to record your name and any bugs you found using the [etherpad](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/MozillaIN_QA_MobileRedesign-contributors-testing)
After the release on March 9, we still welcome you to file any bugs you see!

If you have any questions or would like to talk to your fellow bug hunters during redesign testing, join the #amo channel at [irc.mozilla.org](https://client00.chat.mibbit.com/?url=irc%3A%2F%2Firc.mozilla.org%2Famo)
